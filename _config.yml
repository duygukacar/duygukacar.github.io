# Intro
intro: Born in Istanbul, Duygu has lived in London for the last ten years. She graduated from London College of Fashion in 2014 with a degree in Fashion Design, building on her Art & Design Foundation certificate, and has worked in the fashion industry since 2006 as a designer, creative director and garment production consultant.

# Bio
bio: Her Istanbul upbringing is central to her designs&#58; Their eclecticism, unexpected fabric combinations and frequent juxtapositions of the normal with the surreal spring directly from Istanbul’s unique character as a city equally ancient and modern, with a foot planted in two contrasting continents. Undeniably feminine and yet fascinated with science fiction, the animal, and the other-worldly, Duygu’s pieces experiment with collages of detail and texture to achieve a truly unique look.
